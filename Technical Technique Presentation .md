-   Title: Data Cleansing and Loading into PostgreSQL Database Using Python

## Introduction
- This presentation will delve into the technical process of cleansing data and loading it into a PostgreSQL database using Python. It will highlight the 
  importance of this technique in the realm of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and its pivotal role in ensuring data integrity and reliability.
  
- Objectives of the presentation
-  Provide a comprehensive understanding of the data cleansing and loading process using Python and PostgreSQL.
-  Illustrate the significance of this technique in ETL workflows and data pipeline management.
-  Show the practical knowledge and skills to implement data cleansing and loading techniques.

## Background
- In the realm of ETL processes, data quality is paramount for accurate analysis and decision-making. However, raw data often contains errors, inconsistencies, 
  and missing values, necessitating robust data cleansing techniques. By leveraging Python and PostgreSQL, organizations can streamline their ETL workflows and 
  optimize data integrity.

## Presentation Candidate
- Name: Akomolafe Olawole Seun
- background of the presenter:  An experienced Financial Risk Analyst, with over 8years work experience in Insurance industry as Risk Analyst  and internal 
  control officer, I studied Banking and Finance in my undergraduate.  urrently studying Business Intelligence and Analytics at NSCC IT campus. where I have been 
  learning the application of various Business Intelligence tools and skills such as SSMS, Power BI, Python, SSRS, SSIS, Machine Learning, Postgresql, Microsoft 
  Report Builder etc.

## Sample Data Selection
- Criteria for selecting sample data: Criteria for Selecting Sample Data: Availability of diverse datasets with varying data quality issues.
  Relevance to real-world ETL scenarios and business domains. Access to sample data sources compatible with Python and PostgreSQL.

- Sources of sample data: Publicly available datasets from www.kaggle.com and https://archive.ics.uci.edu
  
- Relevance of the data to the demonstration: The selected sample data will closely resemble real-world ETL scenarios, allowing for practical demonstrations of 
  data cleansing and loading techniques

## Technical Technique Demonstration
- Description of the technical technique: Overview of data cleansing techniques such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data 
  formats using Python libraries. Demonstration of data loading into PostgreSQL tables using Python's sqlalchemy library.

- Steps for applying the technique to the sample data: Data preprocessing: Identifying and addressing data quality issues.
- Establishing a connection to the PostgreSQL database.
-  Loading cleansed data into PostgreSQL tables.
  
- Expected outcomes and benefits:
- Improved data quality and reliability in ETL processes.
- Streamlined data pipeline management and optimization of database performance.
- Enhanced decision-making through access to clean and accurate data.

## Implementation Plan
- Timeline for the preparation of the presentation: 8 Hours
  
- Resources required (software, hardware, etc.): Software:
- Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook.
- Hardware: Standard computer with internet access.
- Sample datasets compatible with Python and PostgreSQL.
  
- Practice sessions and dry runs: Conduct multiple practice sessions to refine content delivery and technical demonstrations.
Solicit feedback from other classmates to identify areas for improvement.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this presentation aims to equip the me with practical skills and insights into cleansing data and loading it into a PostgreSQL database using Python. By mastering these techniques, organizations can enhance their ETL workflows and drive informed decision-making through access to clean and reliable data.
